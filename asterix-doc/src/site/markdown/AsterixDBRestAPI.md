## Query API ##

*End point for query statements*

Parameters:

|| Parameter || Description || Required? ||
|| query     || Query string to pass to ASTERIX for execution || Yes ||
|| mode      || Indicate if call should be synchronous or asynchronous. mode = synchronous blocks the call until results are available; mode = asynchronous returns immediately with a handle that can be used later to check the queryâ€™s status and to fetch results when available || No. default mode = synchronous ||

Result: The result is returned as a JSON object as follows


        {
           results: <result as a string, if mode = synchronous>
           error-code: [<code>, <message>] (if an error occurs)
           handle: <opaque result handle, if mode = asynchronous>
        }


### Example ###

#### Select query with synchronous result delivery ####


        use dataverse company;
        
        for $l in dataset('Employee') return $l;


API call for the above query statement in the URL-encoded form.

              ]
          ]
        }

## Asynchronous Result API ##

*End point to fetch the results of an asynchronous query*

Endpoint: _/query/result_

Parameters:

|| Parameter || Description || Required? ||
|| handle || Result handle that was returned by a previous call to a /query call with mode = asynchronous || Yes ||

Result: The result is returned as a JSON object as follows:


        {
           results: <result as a string, if mode = synchronous, or mode = asynchronous and results are available>
           error-code: [<code>, <message>] (if an error occurs)
        }


If mode = asynchronous and results are not available, the returned JSON object is empty: { }

### Example ###

#### Fetching results for asynchronous query ####

        {
            "handle": [45,0]
        }


API call for reading results from the previous asynchronous query in the URL-encoded form.
